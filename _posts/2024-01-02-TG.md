Torrid Games launched with the iOS game title SurfGod. This game gained attention for its innovative approach, offering a meditative surfing experience aimed at both surfers and non-surfers. In collaboration with oceanic pollution cleanup organizations like Heal the Bay, Torrid Games developed a free version of SurfGod, achieving 20,000 downloads, reflecting the game’s impact and the company’s commitment to raising awareness about oceanic pollution.  Torrid Games is in the process of raising capital to continue this trend at a deeper and broader level with a sequel, SurfGod 2.

SurfGod is really a tongue 'n' cheek term surfers use in the line-up out in the water. "Look at this surfgod!"  It's also a nod to whatever gods might be bringing waves, which we surfers are very grateful for -- "Pray for Surf".

Wah Wah Watson: I’m going to come to your house and we are going to work this Heal the Bay surfing app out.  I have very powerful computers and a super high powered Modem/WiFi router.

Matt:  Wow thanks, that’s uptown Wah Wah.

WW: that’s right cuz I’m an uptown m….f….r 👊

Tay Uhler, Wah Wah produced and engineered scored the music in SurfGod HtB.  In Tay’s studio Matt also played the fretless bass line (directed by Wah Wah).  Subsequent to the release of SurfGod HtB, Wah Wah and I were going to work on a guitar teaching app.  I wanted it to be heavy hitting like him and teach the kind of lessons he taught me.  It would’ve been working with a very intense teacher like I felt he was.  He liked the idea but he wanted it to be nicer.  A mighty, and powerful musician that was super intense at times, but here we are seeing what a sweet guy he was — very much missed.  Working with him on the apps music with Tay Uhler was one of the very bright spots in the initial SurfGod HtB iOS app and it continues to inspire me and keep it moving forward 🤙

PS. Wah Wah Watson also made sound fx for the trash that you grab in the game while you’re surfing.  He additionally gave me some cartoon figures we are currently incorporating into the SG2 VR app.
