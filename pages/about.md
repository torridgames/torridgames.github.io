Torrid Games, established in 2011, initially launched with the game title "SurfGod." This game gained attention for its innovative approach, offering a meditative surfing experience aimed at both surfers and non-surfers. In collaboration with oceanic pollution cleanup organizations like Heal the Bay, Torrid Games developed a free version of SurfGod, achieving 20,000 downloads, reflecting the game's impact and the company's commitment to raising awareness about oceanic pollution.

The success of SurfGod led to the development of "SurfGod 2.0" (SG2), an ambitious project envisioned as a Virtual Reality (VR) surfing app. This app aims to broaden its impact, targeting a diverse customer base including environmentally conscious individuals, educational entities, gamers, families, corporate clients, museums, aquariums, and accessibility-focused groups. This innovative VR app intends to enhance public awareness about oceanic pollution, aligning with Torrid Games' mission to create engaging, message-driven gaming experiences.

Torrid Games' broader vision, under the leadership of founder Matt Fairweather, is to establish itself as a leading developer of AAA titles that are not only entertaining but also contribute to global environmental awareness. The company plans to expand the SG2 experience across various platforms, including mobile phones, tablets, and computers, ensuring accessibility and reach. Torrid Games is planning to organize larger events, bring SG2 to existing events, and leverage social media for greater visibility and sponsorship opportunities.
