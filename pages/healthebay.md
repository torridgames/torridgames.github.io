All profits from SurfGod HtB 1.0 were donated to Heal the Bay.  This will be continuing into the 2.0 version and potentially extended to other non-profits at each's respective level of involvement. Incidentally, the development of the initial app was achieved at minimal cost, almost entirely developed by two people
who have already established the visceral feel of being in the wave -- surfing, and cleaning up our oceans simultaneously.  The majority of the remaining work with the project's sequel will be dedicated to increasing its public visibility as enhancing the app and making it available on all devices including VR/AR is fiarly formulaic in the modern digital development age.

Ana Luisa Moran Ahern, featured in the video, is the Executive Director at EcoViva
Ana and was Heal the Bay Communications Manager from Nov 2011 - Jun 2014.  She was integral to the initial version of SurfGod HtB with art, web, and visibility.  Additionally, she along with an HtB intern, made the original SurfGod standee which had elegantly sculpted 3d elements.  At Heal the Bay, she managed digital content and outreach efforts using a suite of CMS, CRM, and social networking tools. She managed Heal the Bayâ€™s website including Drupal content generation, copy-editing, and production (in both English and Spanish). and social media platforms including Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, Vine, Flickr and YouTube communities for daily content, growth and engagement. She composed/designed and sent weekly e-newsletters to over 50,000 audience members as well as analyzed/tracked audience growth and engagement across all platforms. Ana developed and designed original artwork, collateral and digital content for general and campaign-specific outreach. She created original video and photography content. She trained and supervised interns and volunteers.

With the 2.0 version there is a slightly larger development team albeit still small with additional help from Milken Community School interns providing design, programming, art, and QA support.

Special thanks to Meredith McCarthy, Nancy Shrodes, Tracy Quinn, Alex Babcock, Felipe Macchia Yahn, Jenna Segal, Melissa Aguayo (Speakers Bureau Manager 2008 - 2015), Gabriele Morgan, and all the other amazing staff/volunteers/beach-cleanup-groups at Heal the Bay for their service in the Santa Monica Bay.
