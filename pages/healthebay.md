All profits from SurfGod HtB 1.0 were donated to Heal the Bay.  This will be continuing into the 2.0 version and potentially extended to other non-profits at their respective levels of involvement. Incidentally, the development of the app was achieved at minimal costs as it was almost entirely done by the two people in this video -->

Special gold medal service to the project goes to Ana Luisa Moran Ahern (Ana & Matt in the video above), Executive Director at EcoViva
Ana (Heal the Bay Communications Manager, Nov 2011 - Jun 2014).   She was integral to the initial version of SurfGod HtB with art, web, and visibility.  She made the original SurfGod HtB standee that had 3d-scupltor elements of which you can't really see in the 2d digital version.  At Heal the Bay, she managed digital content and outreach efforts using a suite of CMS, CRM, and social networking tools. She managed Heal the Bayâ€™s website including Drupal content generation, copy-editing, and production (in both English and Spanish). and social media platforms including Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, Vine, Flickr and YouTube communities for daily content, growth and engagement. She composed/designed and sent weekly e-newsletters to over 50,000 audience members as well as analyzed/tracked audience growth and engagement across all platforms. Ana developed and designed original artwork, collateral and digital content for general and campaign-specific outreach. She created original video and photography content. She trained and supervised interns and volunteers.

With the 2.0 version there will be a larger development team however it will still very tight and lean with additional help from Milken Community School interns that will provide design, programming, art, and QA support.

Special thanks to Meredith McCarthy, Nancy Shrodes, Tracy Quinn, Alex Babcock, Felipe Macchia Yahn, Jenna Segal, Melissa Aguayo (Speakers Bureau Manager 2008 - 2015), Gabriele Morgan, and all the other amazing staff/volunteers/beach-cleanup-groups at Heal the Bay for their oceanic service and the Santa Monica Bay.
